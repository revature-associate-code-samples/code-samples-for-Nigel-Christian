<h3>QQBounty</h3>
QQBounty facilitates a micropayment powered question and answer platform. Users can register, login and create content. External payments are processed and transferred to the internal tokens, before content creation. Rewards are offered for suggestions, answers, and advice on myriad subjects. Solutions are rewarded based primarily upon a time-sensitive voting system. The highest rated answer is eligible for a reward through the internal token, which is redeemable.
