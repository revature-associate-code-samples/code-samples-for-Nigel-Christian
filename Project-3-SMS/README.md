<h3>Staging Management System - UI</h3>
The Staging Management System allows managers to keep track of Revature associates who have completed training and are awaiting a job assignment. The application is particularly useful in managing associates who are in virtual staging. The system allows associates to check in daily and provide an update to the staging manager which can then be easily viewed to keep track of what associates are currently working on.
